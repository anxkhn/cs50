The number one reason why people’s accounts get stolen is because they use the same password across multiple places. Any security researcher would strongly disregard this move.
In order to keep your passwords secure, they all have to be unique and difficult to crack. In truth, the best passwords are the ones that you don’t need to remember at all.
For the before mentioned reasons, we decided to make a password manager for everyone to use. This will create a unique password for every single account of yours  and remembers with for you.
